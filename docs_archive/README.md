# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation and guides that have been archived to keep the project root clean.

## Structure

### `historical_assessments/`
Archived assessment documents from development iterations:
- Various OCT 7-8, 2025 assessment snapshots
- Evaluation reports and sanity checks
- Session completion summaries

**Current assessment**: See `/HONEST_ASSESSMENT_2025-10-08.md` in project root

### `guides/`
Archived setup and integration guides:
- APP_PY_REFACTORING_NEEDED.md

**Current guides**: See README.md, CLAUDE.md in project root

### Blueprint Comparisons
- BLUEPRINT_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md
- BLUEPRINT_COMPARISON.md
- BLUEPRINT_VS_CURRENT_COMPARISON.md

**Note**: These were historical analyses. Current assessment uses a different framework.

## Why Archive?

The project root had 32 markdown files, creating confusion about what's current. Essential docs remain in the root:

**Essential docs (in project root):**
1. `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Development guide for Claude Code
3. `HONEST_ASSESSMENT_2025-10-08.md` - Current detailed assessment
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design documentation
5. `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
6. `SECURITY.md` - Security policies
7. `Makefile` - Common development commands

## When to Reference Archived Docs

Reference archived docs when you need:
- Historical context on design decisions
- Previous assessment snapshots
- Detailed guides that supplement core docs
- Blueprint comparison analysis

For current information, always use docs in the project root.
