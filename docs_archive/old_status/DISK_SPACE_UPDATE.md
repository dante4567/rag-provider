# Disk Space Status Update

**Date:** October 7, 2025 00:19 CET

## Current Status

**Before:** 111MB available (100% used)
**Now:** 3.2GB available (still showing 100% used in df)
**Progress:** ✅ 3GB freed up
**Docker:** ❌ Still timing out after 15s

## The Problem

**Disk space improved but Docker still not responsive.**

This could mean:
1. 3.2GB still not enough (recommended: 20GB+)
2. Docker needs restart after disk was freed
3. Docker cached the "disk full" state

## Two Paths Forward

### Path A: Restart Docker (Quick Test)

```bash
# Stop Docker
killall Docker

# Start Docker Desktop
open -a Docker

# Wait 30 seconds for full startup

# Test if it works
docker ps  # Should respond in < 5 seconds
```

**If this works:** We can proceed with Week 3 plan (with limited space)
**If still times out:** Need to free more space

### Path B: Free More Space (Recommended)

**Target:** 20GB+ available

You've freed 3GB which is great, but Docker typically needs more headroom.

**More cleanup options:**
```bash
# Find what's still using space
du -sh ~/Library/* 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -10

# Docker images (when Docker works)
docker system df
docker system prune -a --volumes -f

# Xcode caches (if you have Xcode)
du -sh ~/Library/Developer

# Homebrew caches
brew cleanup -s
```

## Recommendation

**Try Path A first (Docker restart)** - Takes 2 minutes
- If it works → Proceed with Week 3 cautiously
- If fails → Do Path B (free more space)

**Then continue with Week 3 plan:**
1. Pin dependencies (2 hours)
2. Real integration tests (3-5 days)
3. Refactor app.py (3 days)

## What I Can Do Now

**With 3.2GB free:**
- ✅ Small file edits
- ✅ Small commits
- ⚠️ Risky: Large files (low space buffer)
- ❌ Docker operations (still timing out)

**Need Docker working to:**
- Pin dependencies (pip freeze in container)
- Run integration tests (need containers)
- Test refactored code (need test suite)

## Bottom Line

**Good news:** Some disk freed (3.2GB)
**Bad news:** Docker still not working
**Next step:** Restart Docker OR free more space
**Then:** Execute Week 3 plan
