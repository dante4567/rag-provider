## Integration Guide

### How to Use New Services

**Confidence Service (prevent hallucinations):**
```python
from src.services.confidence_service import ConfidenceService

confidence = ConfidenceService(min_overall=0.6)
assessment = confidence.assess_confidence(query, retrieved_chunks)

if not assessment.is_sufficient:
    # Return user-friendly message instead of hallucinating
    return confidence.get_response_for_low_confidence(assessment, query)
```

**HyDE Service (better retrieval):**
```python
from src.services.hyde_service import HyDEService

hyde = HyDEService(llm_service)

# Expand query with hypothetical answers
expanded = await hyde.expand_query_with_hyde(query, num_variants=2)

# Search with all variants
results = await hyde.multi_query_search(
    queries=expanded,
    search_function=your_search_func
)
```

**OCR Queue (quality improvement):**
```python
from src.services.ocr_queue_service import OCRQueueService

ocr_queue = OCRQueueService(confidence_threshold=0.7)

# After OCR
if ocr_queue.should_reocr(confidence, doc_type):
    ocr_queue.add_to_queue(doc_id, file_path, confidence)

# Process queue
for entry in ocr_queue.get_pending_entries(limit=10):
    ocr_queue.mark_processing(entry.doc_id)
    # Re-OCR with better settings
    new_text, new_confidence = improved_ocr(entry.file_path)
    ocr_queue.mark_completed(entry.doc_id, new_confidence)
```

**Monitoring Service:**
```python
from src.services.monitoring_service import MonitoringService

monitor = MonitoringService("rag_service")

# Log requests
monitor.log_request("/search", "POST", 200, duration_ms=123.4)

# Track metrics
monitor.metrics.increment_counter("searches", labels={"user": "alice"})
monitor.metrics.observe_histogram("latency_ms", 45.6)

# Health checks
def check_db():
    return (HealthStatus.HEALTHY, "Connected")

monitor.health.check_component("database", check_db)
```
