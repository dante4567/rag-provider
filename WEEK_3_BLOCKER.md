# Week 3 BLOCKED - Disk Space Critical Issue

**Date:** October 7, 2025 00:07 CET
**Status:** 🚨 CANNOT PROCEED - Docker completely unresponsive
**Disk Usage:** 100% (359GB / 402GB used)

## Brutal Reality

**User requested:** Pin deps + real integration tests + refactoring
**System response:** Docker commands timeout after 30s-2min
**Root cause:** Disk at 100% capacity, system cannot write temp files

## What We Tried

```bash
# All these commands TIMED OUT:
docker container prune -f          # Timeout after 30s
docker stop openwebui-chromadb     # Timeout after 30s
docker ps                          # Timeout after 2min
docker system df                   # Timeout after 2min
```

## Why Docker Is Critical

**To pin dependencies, we need:**
1. Start RAG service Docker container
2. Run `docker exec rag_service pip freeze`
3. Save output to requirements-pinned.txt

**To run integration tests, we need:**
1. Start ChromaDB container
2. Start RAG service container
3. Run pytest inside container

**To test refactoring, we need:**
1. Docker containers running
2. Ability to restart after changes
3. Run full test suite

**Current status:** Can't do ANY of these - Docker completely blocked

## User Action Required (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: Free Up Disk Space

**Critical threshold:** Need at least 20GB free for Docker to function

**Check what's using space:**
```bash
# Find large directories
du -sh ~/* 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -20

# Check Docker (if accessible)
docker system df

# Common culprits
du -sh ~/Library/Caches
du -sh ~/Downloads
du -sh ~/.docker/
du -sh ~/Library/Containers/
```

**Safe cleanup options:**
```bash
# 1. Clear downloads
du -sh ~/Downloads
rm -rf ~/Downloads/*  # Only if you don't need them

# 2. Clear caches
du -sh ~/Library/Caches
# Carefully review before deleting

# 3. Empty trash
rm -rf ~/.Trash/*

# 4. Clear Docker (when Docker responds)
docker system prune -a --volumes -f

# 5. Find large files
find ~ -type f -size +1G 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

### Step 2: Verify Space Available

```bash
df -h .
# Should show at least 20GB available
```

### Step 3: Restart Docker

```bash
# Restart Docker Desktop app
# Or use command:
killall Docker && open -a Docker

# Wait for Docker to fully start
docker ps  # Should respond in < 5 seconds
```

### Step 4: Resume Work

Once Docker is responsive, we can proceed with:
1. Stop OpenWebUI containers
2. Start RAG service
3. Pin dependencies
4. Add integration tests
5. Refactor app.py

## What We CAN Do Now (Limited)

✅ **Small file edits** - Text files under 10KB
✅ **Small commits** - Already committed WEEK_3_PLAN.md
✅ **Documentation** - This file

❌ **Docker operations** - All timeout
❌ **Large file edits** - Risk corruption
❌ **Testing** - Can't run containers
❌ **Code changes** - Can't validate

## Honest Timeline

**If user frees 20GB+ today:**
- Phase 1 (Pin deps): 2 hours
- Phase 2 (Integration tests): 3-5 days
- Phase 3 (Refactoring): 3 days
- **Total:** 1-2 weeks to A- (85/100)

**If disk stays at 100%:**
- Week 3: BLOCKED
- Cannot improve grade
- Stuck at C+ (74/100)

## What Happens If We Don't Fix This

**Short term:**
- Cannot pin dependencies → Unpinned deps remain
- Cannot add integration tests → Refactoring remains risky
- Cannot refactor → Code stays messy
- Grade stays C+ (74/100)

**Medium term:**
- Docker may become completely unusable
- System performance degrades
- Risk of file corruption
- Other apps may fail

**Long term:**
- Disk failure possible
- Data loss risk
- System requires reinstall

## Recommendation

**STOP ALL DEVELOPMENT WORK**
**FIX DISK SPACE FIRST**
**Then proceed with Week 3 plan**

This is not optional. Docker will not function at 100% disk usage.

## Bottom Line

**Prepared:** Complete Week 3 plan ready (pin deps → tests → refactor)
**Blocked:** Disk at 100%, Docker unresponsive
**Required:** User must free 20GB+ before we can proceed
**ETA:** 2 hours to fix disk, then 1-2 weeks for improvements

Being brutally honest: We're ready to improve to A- grade,
but physically blocked by disk space. No workaround possible.

*Week 3 plan exists. Execution blocked by hardware constraint.*
