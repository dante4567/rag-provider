"""
E2E Test: Entity Format Pipeline

This test would have caught the bug we spent 4 hours debugging today.

WHAT IT TESTS:
1. Documents are enriched with entity extraction
2. Entities are stored in ChromaDB (flattened format)
3. Entities can be retrieved from ChromaDB
4. Entity enrichment can parse entities from ChromaDB
5. WikiLinks are generated correctly from metadata

BUG IT CATCHES:
- Mismatch between enrichment output (nested) and ChromaDB storage (flat)
- Missing entity fields in ChromaDB metadata
- Entity enrichment finding 0 entities due to format issues
