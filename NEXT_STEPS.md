# Next Steps: Your Action Plan
**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Time Required:** 5-10 minutes (then wait for validation)

---

## üö¶ Current Status

**Search Timeout:** ‚úÖ FIXED (Docker volume caching model)
**Voyage Rate Limiting:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED - Needs your action**

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Docker containers healthy
- ‚úÖ Model downloading in background
- ‚úÖ 3 documents indexed

**What's Not Working:**
- ‚ùå Bulk ingestion (3% success rate)
- ‚ùå Search queries (Voyage rate limited)
- ‚ùå Production deployment (blocked by Voyage)

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION (5 minutes - DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Add Voyage Payment Method

1. Open browser: https://dashboard.voyageai.com/
2. Sign in with your account
3. Click **"Billing"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"Add Payment Method"**
5. Enter credit card details
6. Click **Save**

**What This Does:**
- Rate limits increase automatically (within 5 minutes)
- 3 RPM ‚Üí 300 RPM (100x improvement)
- 10K TPM ‚Üí 1M TPM (100x improvement)

**Cost:**
- $0 upfront
- 200M free tokens (Voyage-3 series)
- After free tokens: $0.02 per 1M tokens
- Expected: $2-5/month for typical usage

---

### Step 2: Wait 5 Minutes

After adding payment:
1. Wait 5 minutes for rate limits to propagate
2. Get a coffee ‚òï
3. Come back

---

### Step 3: Test Search (Verify Fix)

```bash
# Test search (should complete in 5-10s including model download)
curl -s "http://localhost:8001/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "python programming", "top_k": 5}' | jq

# Expected:
# - First time: ~3-5s (includes model download if needed)
# - Subsequent: <2s ‚úÖ
```

**If it works:** Search returns results with `results_count > 0` ‚úÖ

**If it fails:**
- Check logs: `docker logs rag_service --tail 30`
- Wait another 5 minutes (rate limits may take longer)
- Try again

---

### Step 4: Re-run Batch Ingestion Test

```bash
# This will ingest ~20 documents (takes 10-15 minutes with rate limiting)
bash scripts/batch_ingest_test.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- **Before Voyage fix:** 3% success rate (4/120)
- **After Voyage fix:** >90% success rate (18-20/20)

**Watch for:**
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks for successful ingestions
- ‚ùå Red X marks for failures
- Final stats at the end

---

### Step 5: Verify Success

```bash
# Check final corpus size
curl -s http://localhost:8001/stats | jq

# Expected:
# {
#   "total_documents": 18-23,
#   "total_chunks": 50-100
# }
```

**If successful:** You're ready for production! üéâ

## üìã Optional Follow-Up Tasks (After Verification)

### This Week (4-6 hours)

1. **Benchmark Retrieval Quality** (2-3 hours)
   ```bash
   # Run gold queries (script needs to be created)
   # File ready: evaluation/gold_queries.yaml (30 queries)
   ```

2. **Performance Testing** (1-2 hours)
   - Measure search latency (p50, p95, p99)
   - Test with 100, 1000, 10000 docs
   - Document resource usage

3. **Activate CI/CD** (5 minutes)
   - See: `CI_CD_ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Add API keys to GitHub Secrets
   - Verify workflows run green

4. **Fix Integration Tests** (2-3 hours)
   - Add mocks for external APIs
   - Separate fast/slow suites
   - Target: 95%+ pass rate

### This Month (1-2 weeks)

5. **Implement Hybrid Embeddings** (3-4 hours)
   - Local embeddings for bulk ingestion
   - Voyage for search queries
   - Minimize API costs

6. **Add Observability** (1 week)
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alerts for failures

7. **Production Deployment** (1 week)
   - Choose hosting (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
   - Configure monitoring
   - Deploy with CI/CD

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Search Still Slow (>10s)

**Symptom:** Searches take >10 seconds
**Cause:** Model still downloading

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check logs for model download status
docker logs rag_service -f | grep -i "rerank\|loading"

# Wait for: "‚úÖ Reranking model loaded successfully"
```

**Time:** First download takes 3-5 minutes (one-time)

---

### Ingestion Still Failing (Rate Limits)

**Symptom:** Still getting Voyage rate limit errors
**Cause:** Rate limits haven't propagated yet

**Fix:**
1. Check Voyage dashboard billing page (verify payment added)
2. Wait 5-10 more minutes
3. Try again
4. If still failing after 15 minutes, contact Voyage support

---

### Search Returns 0 Results

**Symptom:** Search works but returns `results_count: 0`
**Cause:** No documents indexed yet

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check how many documents are indexed
curl -s http://localhost:8001/stats | jq '.total_documents'

# If 0: Run batch ingestion test
bash scripts/batch_ingest_test.sh
```

---

### Docker Container Crashed

**Symptom:** `curl http://localhost:8001/health` fails
**Cause:** Container may have run out of memory

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep rag

# Check logs for errors
docker logs rag_service --tail 100

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart
```

2. ‚úÖ Search returns actual results (`results_count > 0`)
3. ‚úÖ Batch ingestion succeeds at >90% rate
4. ‚úÖ Stats show 18-23 documents indexed
5. ‚úÖ No Voyage rate limit errors in logs

**Then:** System is production-ready! üéâ

---

## üéØ TL;DR - Just Do This

1. **Add Voyage payment:** https://dashboard.voyageai.com/ (5 min)
2. **Wait 5 minutes**
3. **Test search:** `curl http://localhost:8001/search ...`
4. **Run batch test:** `bash scripts/batch_ingest_test.sh`
5. **Verify stats:** `curl http://localhost:8001/stats`

**Expected outcome:** >90% ingestion success, <2s searches, production-ready system.
