## 🔍 CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

### Discovery 1: Memory Scaling
**Finding**: Memory usage spikes to 99% during batch processing

**Implications**:
- ⚠️ Current 2GB limit is barely sufficient for 100-doc batches
- ✅ No memory leaks (recovers to 30%)
- 📈 Recommend 4GB RAM for production
- 💡 Consider processing queue for large batches

**Action**: Document memory requirements

### Discovery 2: Tag Learning Improves with Scale
**Finding**: 82% reuse at 84 docs vs 77.5% at 49 docs

**Why**: More documents = better pattern recognition

**Implications**:
- ✅ System will get BETTER as it processes more
- ✅ Tag taxonomy will stabilize over time
- ✅ SmartNotes workflow tags are universal

**Action**: None - this is excellent!

### Discovery 3: Batch Processing Works
**Finding**: Successfully handled 100-file upload

**Implications**:
- ✅ Web UI robust
- ✅ Backend handles sequential processing
- ✅ No queue overflow
- ⚠️ High memory during bursts

**Action**: Add progress indicator for UX

### Discovery 4: Timeouts During Heavy Load
**Finding**: HTTP timeouts during peak processing

**Why**: Service busy with enrichment

**Implications**:
- ⚠️ UX issue during heavy load
- ✅ Not a failure (processing continues)
- 💡 Need async status endpoint

**Action**: Add job queue + status API
