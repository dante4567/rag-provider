      "content": "BERT and GPT represent two different approaches to transformer architectures:\n\n**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**\n- Uses encoder-only architecture\n- Bidirectional attention (can see both left and right context)\n- Pre-trained with masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction\n- Excellent for understanding tasks: classification, question answering, sentiment analysis\n- Cannot generate text naturally\n\n**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):**\n- Uses decoder-only architecture\n- Unidirectional attention (causal/left-to-right)\n- Pre-trained with autoregressive language modeling\n- Excellent for generation tasks: text completion, creative writing, code generation\n- Can be fine-tuned for understanding tasks but less naturally suited\n\n**Key Trade-offs:**\n- BERT sees full context but can't generate\n- GPT generates fluently but only sees previous tokens\n- BERT better for classification, GPT better for generation"

      "content": "Attention mechanisms have evolved significantly:\n\n**T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):**\n- **Encoder-decoder architecture** combining both approaches\n- Encoder uses bidirectional attention (like BERT)\n- Decoder uses causal attention (like GPT) plus cross-attention to encoder\n- Relative positional encoding instead of absolute\n- Can handle both understanding and generation tasks\n\n**Modern LLM Attention Improvements:**\n\n1. **Sparse Attention Patterns:**\n   - Longformer: Local + global attention\n   - BigBird: Random, window, and global attention\n   - Reduces O(n²) complexity for long sequences\n\n2. **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE):**\n   - Used in models like GPT-NeoX, LLaMA\n   - Encodes position info directly in attention computation\n   - Better extrapolation to longer sequences\n\n3. **Multi-Query Attention (MQA):**\n   - Shares key/value across attention heads\n   - Faster inference with minimal quality loss\n   - Used in PaLM, Falcon\n\n4. **Grouped Query Attention (GQA):**\n   - Compromise between MHA and MQA\n   - Groups heads to share K/V\n   - Used in LLaMA 2\n\n5. **Flash Attention:**\n   - Memory-efficient attention computation\n   - Enables training on longer sequences\n   - IO-aware algorithm design\n\n**Recent Trends:**\n- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Sparse activation of expert networks\n- **State Space Models**: Alternative to attention (Mamba, etc.)\n- **Linear Attention**: Approximations to reduce quadratic complexity"
