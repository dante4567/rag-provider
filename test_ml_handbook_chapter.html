    <h1>Chapter 5: Deep Learning Fundamentals</h1>
    
    <h2>5.1 Introduction to Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>Deep learning represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. This chapter explores the fundamental concepts that make deep learning so powerful.</p>
    
    <h3>5.1.1 The Perceptron</h3>
    <p>The journey begins with the perceptron, the simplest form of a neural network. A perceptron takes multiple inputs, applies weights, and produces a single output through an activation function.</p>
    
    <h3>5.1.2 Multi-Layer Perceptrons</h3>
    <p>By stacking perceptrons in layers, we create multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) capable of learning non-linear relationships. The key innovation is the use of hidden layers between input and output.</p>
    
    <h2>5.2 Backpropagation Algorithm</h2>
    <p>The backpropagation algorithm is the cornerstone of deep learning training. It efficiently computes gradients by propagating errors backward through the network.</p>
    
    <h3>5.2.1 Forward Pass</h3>
    <p>During the forward pass, input data flows through the network, layer by layer, until it reaches the output. Each neuron applies its activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs.</p>
    
    <h3>5.2.2 Backward Pass</h3>
    <p>The backward pass computes gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter using the chain rule of calculus. This allows us to update weights to minimize the loss.</p>
    
    <h2>5.3 Activation Functions</h2>
    <p>Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):</strong> f(x) = max(0, x) - Simple and effective</li>
        <li><strong>Sigmoid:</strong> f(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x)) - Smooth activation, values between 0 and 1</li>
        <li><strong>Tanh:</strong> f(x) = tanh(x) - Values between -1 and 1</li>
        <li><strong>GELU:</strong> Used in modern transformers like BERT</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5.4 Regularization Techniques</h2>
    <p>To prevent overfitting and improve generalization, several regularization techniques are employed:</p>
    
    <h3>5.4.1 Dropout</h3>
    <p>Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, preventing the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons.</p>
    
    <h3>5.4.2 Batch Normalization</h3>
    <p>Batch normalization normalizes layer inputs, accelerating training and improving stability.</p>
    
    <h3>5.4.3 L1 and L2 Regularization</h3>
    <p>These techniques add penalty terms to the loss function to discourage large weights.</p>
    
    <h2>5.5 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
    <p>CNNs revolutionized computer vision by using convolutional layers that can detect local features regardless of their position in the input.</p>
    
    <h3>5.5.1 Convolution Operation</h3>
    <p>The convolution operation applies filters across the input, creating feature maps that highlight specific patterns.</p>
    
    <h3>5.5.2 Pooling Layers</h3>
    <p>Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important information, typically using max pooling or average pooling.</p>
    
    <h2>5.6 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h2>
    <p>RNNs process sequential data by maintaining hidden states that carry information from previous time steps.</p>
    
    <h3>5.6.1 LSTM Networks</h3>
    <p>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks solve the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs using gates to control information flow.</p>
    
    <h3>5.6.2 GRU Networks</h3>
    <p>Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) provide a simpler alternative to LSTMs with comparable performance.</p>
    
    <h2>5.7 Transformer Architecture</h2>
    <p>Transformers have become the dominant architecture in NLP, using self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel.</p>
    
    <h3>5.7.1 Self-Attention</h3>
    <p>Self-attention allows each position in a sequence to attend to all positions, capturing long-range dependencies effectively.</p>
    
    <h3>5.7.2 Multi-Head Attention</h3>
    <p>Multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously.</p>
    
    <h2>5.8 Training Deep Networks</h2>
    <p>Training deep networks requires careful consideration of optimization algorithms, learning rates, and initialization strategies.</p>
    
    <h3>5.8.1 Optimization Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SGD:</strong> Stochastic Gradient Descent - Simple but effective</li>
        <li><strong>Adam:</strong> Adaptive moment estimation - Popular for its adaptive learning rates</li>
        <li><strong>AdamW:</strong> Adam with weight decay - Improved generalization</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5.8.2 Learning Rate Scheduling</h3>
    <p>Learning rate schedules help converge to better solutions by adjusting the learning rate during training.</p>
    
    <h2>5.9 Modern Architectures</h2>
    <p>Recent advances have led to increasingly powerful architectures:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ResNet:</strong> Residual connections enable very deep networks</li>
        <li><strong>DenseNet:</strong> Dense connections improve feature reuse</li>
        <li><strong>EfficientNet:</strong> Compound scaling for optimal efficiency</li>
        <li><strong>Vision Transformer (ViT):</strong> Transformers for computer vision</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5.10 Practical Considerations</h2>
    <p>Successfully applying deep learning requires understanding practical aspects:</p>
    
    <h3>5.10.1 Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>Proper data preprocessing is crucial for model performance, including normalization, augmentation, and handling missing values.</p>
    
    <h3>5.10.2 Model Selection</h3>
    <p>Choosing the right architecture depends on the problem domain, data characteristics, and computational constraints.</p>
    
    <h3>5.10.3 Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
    <p>Systematic hyperparameter optimization can significantly improve model performance.</p>
