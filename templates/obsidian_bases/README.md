## Tips for Creating Effective Bases

1. **Start Simple:** Create 1-2 bases first, then expand
2. **Use Clear Names:** "Urgent Emails" not "Base 1"
3. **Multiple Views:** Group related filters in one base file
4. **Test Filters:** Start broad, then add specific filters
5. **Property Selection:** Only show properties you actually need

---

## Creating a Dashboard

Combine multiple bases in one note for an overview:

**Create: "Dashboard.md"**

```markdown
# My Knowledge Dashboard

## ðŸ”¥ Urgent Action Items
![[Action Items.base#Urgent]]

## ðŸ“§ Recent Emails
![[Emails.base#This Week]]

## ðŸ’¡ Current Projects
![[Projects.base]]

## ðŸ‘¥ Recent Contacts
![[People.base#Recently Added]]
```
