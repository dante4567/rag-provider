# Model Governance & Testing

## Quick Reference

**Question:** "How do I know the right LLM/embedding is being used?"

**Answer:** See this document + `MODEL_DECISION_MATRIX.md` + run `pytest tests/unit/test_model_choices.py`

## Model Usage Summary

| Use Case | Model | Cost/Call | Why | Configurable |
|----------|-------|-----------|-----|--------------|
| **Enrichment** | Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant | $0.00009 | Cheapest, fast, good enough | ⚠️ Hardcoded |
| **Triage** | Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant | $0.00009 | Simple task, cost-sensitive | ⚠️ Hardcoded |
| **Critique** | Claude Sonnet 3.5 | $0.005 | Quality matters, low volume | ⚠️ Hardcoded |
| **Chat** | User choice | Variable | User preference | ✅ Yes |
| **Embeddings** | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | $0 | Free, fast, private | ⚠️ ChromaDB default |
| **Reranking** | cross-encoder MS MARCO | $0 | Free, good quality | ⚠️ Service default |

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (Verify Model Selection)

**Run:**
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_model_choices.py -v
```

**What It Tests:**
- ✅ Enrichment uses Groq
- ✅ Triage uses Groq
- ✅ Critique uses Claude Sonnet
- ✅ Cost calculations are correct
- ✅ Fallback chain is properly ordered
- ✅ Local embeddings/reranking are free

**Example Output:**
```
test_enrichment_title_extraction_uses_groq PASSED
test_enrichment_triage_uses_groq PASSED
test_critique_uses_claude_sonnet PASSED
test_enrichment_cost_under_threshold PASSED
test_critique_cost_in_expected_range PASSED
test_fallback_chain_order PASSED
```

### 2. Cost Tracking Tests

**Run:**
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_llm_service.py::TestCostTracker -v
```

**What It Tests:**
- ✅ Groq cost: $0.00009 per enrichment
- ✅ Claude Sonnet cost: ~$0.005 per critique
- ✅ Cost tracking accuracy
- ✅ Budget enforcement

### 3. Integration Tests (Live API)

**Run:**
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_llm_provider_quality.py -v
```

**What It Tests:**
- ✅ All providers available in /health endpoint
- ✅ Provider-specific models listed
- ⚠️ May hit rate limits in CI/CD

### 4. Manual Verification

**Check Current Costs:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/cost/stats
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "total_cost_today": 0.45,
  "cost_by_provider": {
    "groq": 0.30,      // Most calls (enrichment/triage)
    "anthropic": 0.15   // Fewer calls (critique)
  },
  "operation_count": 523
}
```

**Expected Ratio:** Groq should be ~2-3x more calls than Anthropic (if critique is enabled)

## Decision Validation

### Why Groq for Enrichment? ✅

**Comparison:**
| Provider | Input | Output | 1K Docs Cost | Quality | Speed |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Groq | $0.05/1M | $0.08/1M | **$0.09** | Good | Ultra fast |
| Claude Haiku | $0.25/1M | $1.25/1M | $0.90 | Excellent | Fast |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.15/1M | $0.60/1M | $0.40 | Good | Fast |

**Verdict:** Groq saves $0.31-$0.81 per 1K docs with acceptable quality.

### Why Claude Sonnet for Critique? ✅

**Comparison:**
| Provider | 1K Critiques | Quality | Reasoning |
|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Groq | $0.09 | Good | Basic |
| Claude Sonnet | **$5.00** | Excellent | Best |
| GPT-4o | $5.00 | Excellent | Excellent |

**Verdict:** Worth $4.91 extra per 1K for high-quality nuanced feedback. This is optional/low-volume.

### Why Local Embeddings? ✅

**Comparison (10K documents):**
| Model | Cost | Quality | Privacy | Speed |
|-------|------|---------|---------|-------|
| MiniLM (local) | **$0** | Good | ✅ Local | Fast |
| OpenAI small | $4.00 | Excellent | ❌ API | API latency |
| OpenAI large | $26.00 | Best | ❌ API | API latency |

**Verdict:** Save $4-$26 per 10K docs, good enough quality, privacy bonus.

## Configuration & Overrides

### Current: Mostly Hardcoded

**Hardcoded Decisions:**
```python
# src/services/enrichment_service.py:434
model_id="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant"  # Enrichment

# src/services/enrichment_service.py:625
model_id="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant"  # Triage

# src/services/enrichment_service.py:1125
model_id="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Critique
```

**Rationale:** These are deliberate choices based on cost/quality analysis, not oversights.

### Future: Make Configurable

**Add to .env:**
```bash
# Model Selection (Optional)
ENRICHMENT_MODEL=groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant
TRIAGE_MODEL=groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant
CRITIQUE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Alternative: Use Claude for everything (higher quality, higher cost)
# ENRICHMENT_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307
# CRITIQUE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

**Implementation:** 1-2 hours to add environment variable support.

## Fallback Chain

### Configuration

```bash
# .env
DEFAULT_LLM=groq
FALLBACK_LLM=anthropic
EMERGENCY_LLM=openai
```

### Order

1. **Groq** (primary) - Cheapest, fastest
2. **Anthropic** (fallback) - Higher quality when Groq fails
3. **OpenAI** (emergency) - Most reliable backup

### Testing Fallback

**Unit Test:**
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_llm_service.py::TestFallbackChain -v
```

**Manual Test:**
```bash
# Intentionally use invalid Groq key to force fallback
export GROQ_API_KEY=invalid
docker-compose restart rag-service

# Make request - should fallback to Anthropic
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/ingest -d '{"content": "test"}'

# Check logs - should see "Provider groq failed, trying anthropic"
docker-compose logs rag-service | grep -i fallback
```

## Cost Monitoring

### Real-Time Tracking

**Endpoint:** `GET /cost/stats`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "total_cost_today": 0.45,
  "total_cost_all_time": 12.34,
  "operation_count": 523,
  "budget_remaining": 9.55,
  "cost_by_provider": {
    "groq": 0.30,      // Should be majority
    "anthropic": 0.15  // Should be minority (critique only)
  }
}
```

### Expected Patterns

**Normal Usage (1000 documents):**
```
- Enrichment: 1000 calls × $0.00009 = $0.09 (Groq)
- Triage: 1000 calls × $0.00009 = $0.09 (Groq)
- Critique: 100 calls × $0.005 = $0.50 (Claude, optional)
- Total: ~$0.68
```

**If Costs Are Unexpected:**

1. **Groq cost too high?**
   - Check if enrichment is being called excessively
   - Verify bulk operations are batched

2. **Anthropic cost too high?**
   - Check if critique is enabled by default (should be optional)
   - Verify fallback isn't triggering too often

3. **OpenAI being used?**
   - Should be rare (emergency only)
   - Check logs for provider failures

### Budget Protection

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
DAILY_BUDGET_USD=10.0
```

**Enforcement:**
- Checks budget before each LLM call
- Raises exception if budget exceeded
- Resets daily at midnight UTC

**Test Budget Enforcement:**
```bash
# Set low budget
export DAILY_BUDGET_USD=0.01
docker-compose restart rag-service

# Try to process many documents
# Should fail with "Daily budget limit reached" after ~100 enrichments
```

## Quarterly Review Process

### Every 3 Months

1. **Check Provider Pricing**
   - Visit Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google pricing pages
   - Update `MODEL_PRICING` dict in `src/services/llm_service.py`
   - Commit with note: "Update pricing - [Provider] [Model] changed to $X"

2. **Review Model Choices**
   - Run cost analysis: `grep "cost" logs/app.log | tail -1000`
   - Check if new models are available (e.g., Groq Llama 3.2)
   - Test quality: Compare outputs on golden dataset

3. **Update Tests**
   - Verify `test_model_choices.py` still passes
   - Update cost thresholds if pricing changed
   - Add tests for new models

4. **Document Changes**
   - Update `MODEL_DECISION_MATRIX.md`
   - Note any model switches in CHANGELOG
   - Update README cost estimates

## Common Questions

### "Why is Groq free tier?"

**It's not.** You're using Groq with a paid API key. Groq charges per token ($0.05-0.08 per 1M), which is cheapest option. Free tier limits requests/day, not cost.

### "Should I use Claude for everything?"

**No.** Claude is 5-60x more expensive than Groq. Use Claude where quality matters (critique), Groq where cost matters (enrichment, triage).

**Cost Comparison (10K documents):**
- All Groq: $1.80
- All Claude Haiku: $18.00 (+$16.20)
- All Claude Sonnet: $100.00 (+$98.20)

### "Can I use OpenAI embeddings?"

**Yes, but expensive.** Local embeddings save $10-$65 per 1M documents. OpenAI embeddings are better, but not 10-65x better for general RAG.

**When to Upgrade:** Specialized domains (legal, medical) or multilingual needs.

### "How do I know fallback is working?"

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs rag-service | grep -E "fallback|failed|trying"
```

**Expected output when Groq fails:**
```
Provider groq failed: 429 Too Many Requests
Trying fallback provider: anthropic
✅ Anthropic succeeded
```

### "Can I test different models?"

**Yes, for chat:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is X?",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
  }'
```

**For enrichment:** Currently hardcoded, but can add env var override (1-2 hours).
