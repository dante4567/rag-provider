# Using Obsidian Bases with RAG Provider

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

---

## What are Obsidian Bases?

**Bases** is a core Obsidian plugin (v1.9+) that lets you create **database-like views** of your notes without any programming knowledge. Think of it as "Notion databases, but for Obsidian."

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Filter notes by properties (tags, dates, custom fields)
- ‚úÖ Display results in interactive tables
- ‚úÖ Edit properties inline
- ‚úÖ Embed database views in other notes
- ‚úÖ No coding required (unlike Dataview)

**Good News:** Your RAG-generated notes are **already optimized for Bases!** All the metadata we generate in YAML frontmatter works perfectly with Bases filtering and display.

## Why Our Notes Work Perfectly with Bases

### Rich Frontmatter Properties

Every note generated by RAG Provider includes extensive metadata:

```yaml
---
id: "20241016_project_update_a4f2"
title: "Project Update - Q4 2024"
doc_type: "email"
semantic_document_type: "business/communication/email"
created_at: "2024-10-16"
ingested_at: "2024-10-16"

# Entities
people: ["Alice Smith", "Bob Jones"]
organizations: ["Villa Luna", "OpenAI"]
places: ["Cologne"]
projects: ["school-2026"]
topics:
  - "business/project-management"
  - "technology/ai"

# Email-specific
sender: "alice@example.com"
recipients: ["bob@example.com"]
subject: "Project Update - Q4 2024"
thread_id: "thread_abc123"
has_attachments: true
attachment_count: 2

# Quality indicators
has_action_items: true
is_urgent: false
has_code: false

# Chat-specific
turn_count: 15
technologies_mentioned: ["Python", "Docker", "FastAPI"]
---
```

**All of these properties are filterable in Bases!**

---

## Supported Property Types

| Bases Type | Our Properties | Example Use Case |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Text** | `title`, `doc_type`, `sender` | Filter emails by sender |
| **List** | `people`, `topics`, `projects` | Show docs about specific topics |
| **Number** | `attachment_count`, `turn_count` | Find emails with >3 attachments |
| **Checkbox** | `has_attachments`, `is_urgent`, `has_code` | Show only urgent emails |
| **Date** | `created_at`, `ingested_at` | Sort by creation date |

---

## Recommended Base Views

Here are 6 powerful database views you can create immediately:

### 1. **All Documents** (Master List)

**Purpose:** Browse all your ingested documents

**Filter:**
```
No filter (shows all notes in vault)
```

**Properties to Display:**
- title
- doc_type
- created_at
- topics (first 2)
- people (first 3)

**Sort:** `created_at` descending (newest first)

**Use Case:** "What did I ingest recently?"

---

### 2. **Emails** (Inbox View)

**Purpose:** Email database with sender/recipient filtering

## Advanced Filtering Examples

### Emails from Specific Person
```
doc_type = "email"
AND sender contains "alice"
```

### Urgent Emails This Week
```
doc_type = "email"
AND is_urgent = true
AND created_at > today - 7 days
```

### Chat Logs About Python
```
doc_type = "llm_chat"
AND technologies_mentioned contains "Python"
```

### Documents with Attachments
```
has_attachments = true
AND attachment_count > 2
```

### Villa Luna Related Documents
```
organizations contains "Villa Luna"
OR places contains "Villa Luna"
OR topics contains "education/kindergarten"
```

## Embedding Bases in Notes

You can embed a Base view inside another note:

**Syntax:**
```markdown
![[All Documents.base]]
```

**Embed Specific View:**
```markdown
![[Emails.base#Urgent Emails]]
```

**Use Case:** Create a "Dashboard" note with multiple embedded bases:

```markdown
# My Dashboard

## Urgent Items
![[Action Items.base#High Priority]]

## Recent Emails
![[Emails.base#This Week]]

## Current Projects
![[Projects.base#Active]]
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Start Simple**
Don't create 20 bases immediately. Start with:
- All Documents (browse everything)
- Emails (if you ingest emails)
- Action Items (tasks)

### 2. **Use Meaningful Names**
- ‚ùå Bad: "Base 1", "Untitled"
- ‚úÖ Good: "Urgent Emails", "Q4 Projects", "Python Chats"

### 3. **Group Related Views**
Create multiple views in one base:
- "Emails.base"
  - View 1: "All Emails"
  - View 2: "Urgent"
  - View 3: "This Week"

### 4. **Leverage Lists**
Our list properties (`people`, `topics`) are perfect for filtering:
```
topics contains "technology/ai"
people contains "Alice Smith"
```

### 5. **Combine Filters**
Use `AND` / `OR` for powerful queries:
```
(doc_type = "email" AND is_urgent = true)
OR
(has_action_items = true AND status = "pending")
```

### 6. **Create a Dashboard Note**
Embed multiple bases in one note for at-a-glance overview:

```markdown
# Daily Dashboard

## üî• Urgent Today
![[Action Items.base#Urgent]]

## üìß New Emails
![[Emails.base#Today]]

## üí¨ Recent Chats
![[All Documents.base#LLM Chats This Week]]
```

## Comparison: Bases vs. Dataview

| Feature | Bases | Dataview |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Coding Required** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (JavaScript-like) |
| **Learning Curve** | Low (GUI-based) | High (syntax to learn) |
| **Inline Editing** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Flexibility** | Medium | Very High |
| **Performance** | Fast | Can be slow |
| **Best For** | Browsing, filtering | Complex queries, calculations |

**Our Recommendation:**
- Use **Bases** for everyday browsing and filtering
- Use **Dataview** for complex aggregations and custom displays

**Good News:** Both work with our YAML frontmatter!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Property not showing in filter dropdown"

**Cause:** Property doesn't exist in any note yet

**Fix:** Ingest at least one document with that property, then refresh base

---

### "Filter returns no results"

**Checks:**
1. Property name spelled correctly? (case-sensitive)
2. Value matches exactly? (`"email"` vs `"Email"`)
3. List property? Use `contains` instead of `=`
4. Date format correct? (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Wrong: `topics = "technology/ai"` (lists need `contains`)
- ‚úÖ Right: `topics contains "technology/ai"`

---

### "Can't edit property inline"

**Cause:** Not all property types support inline editing

**Currently Editable:** Checkbox, some text fields

**Not Editable:** Lists, dates (use frontmatter editor)

---

## Future Enhancements (Coming Soon)

We're planning to add:

1. **Starter Base Templates** - Pre-configured `.base` files you can copy
2. **Status & Priority Properties** - Workflow management fields
3. **Auto-generated Bases** - System creates common views on first run

See our [GitHub roadmap](https://github.com/dante4567/rag-provider) for updates.
