# V3.0 Migration History

**Status:** ✅ Released as v3.0.0 (October 14, 2025)

**Baseline:** v2.2.0 (Voyage + Mixedbread, 585 unit tests passing)
**Final Release:** v3.0.0 (LiteLLM + Instructor, 955 test functions, 744 LOC app.py)
**Time Taken:** 3 weeks (Oct 7 - Oct 14, 2025)

## Overview

Successfully modernized architecture with battle-tested libraries, modular routes, and type-safe APIs. Focus was on **maintainability** and **reliability** over raw LOC reduction.

### What Was Accomplished

✅ **Phase 1: LiteLLM Integration** - Migrated to unified LLM API (528 LOC with enhanced features)
- Support for 100+ providers via single interface
- Cost tracking preserved via wrapper pattern
- Automatic retries and fallback chains
- All 17 LLM service tests passing

✅ **Phase 2: Instructor Integration** - Type-safe structured outputs (primary enrichment method)
- 12 Pydantic models in `enrichment_models.py` (173 LOC)
- Automatic validation with helpful error messages
- SchemaValidator kept for optional iteration loop (backwards compatibility)
- All 20 enrichment tests passing

✅ **Phase 3: Test Coverage** - Comprehensive test suite with 955 test functions
- 41 unit test files covering all critical services
- 14,654 lines of test code
- Added tests for RAGService, ActionabilityFilter, EntityNameFilter
- Integration tests with smoke test suite for CI/CD

✅ **Phase 4: Architecture Cleanup** - Modular structure with orchestrator pattern
- app.py: 1,472 → 744 LOC (49% reduction)
- Created RAGService orchestrator (1,069 LOC, 21 methods)
- 10 modular route files with clean separation
- Hybrid approach: routes + direct endpoints for enhanced features

### Results

- **Architecture:** Modular routes, RAGService orchestrator, clean separation of concerns
- **Reliability:** Battle-tested libraries (LiteLLM, Instructor) replace custom code
- **Type Safety:** Pydantic validation prevents runtime errors
- **Maintainability:** Easier to modify, extend, and debug
- **Testing:** 955 test functions provide comprehensive coverage
- **Flexibility:** 100+ LLM providers supported via unified API

### What Was NOT Done (Intentionally)

❌ **Phase 3 Optional: Unstructured Integration** - Correctly skipped
- Unstructured installed for specialized use (table extraction only)
- Primary document parsing uses well-tested custom DocumentService
- Custom parsers work well, migration deemed unnecessary

### Honest Metrics

**LOC Changes:**
- app.py: -728 LOC (49% reduction) ✅
- llm_service.py: -16 LOC (3% reduction, grew with features)
- rag_service.py: +1,069 LOC (new orchestrator)
- Net change: +325 LOC total

**Key Insight:** Code grew slightly, but **quality** and **maintainability** improved dramatically. The value is in architecture, not raw LOC count.

## Original Migration Plan (For Reference)

Major architectural upgrade to consolidate custom code into battle-tested libraries, simplify maintenance, and improve reliability.

## Phase 1: LiteLLM Integration (Week 1) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

### What Changes
Replace custom `llm_service.py` (400 LOC) with LiteLLM unified API.

**Before:**
```python
# Custom fallback chain, retry logic, provider-specific code
class LLMService:
    def call_llm(self, provider, model, prompt):
        try:
            if provider == "groq":
                return self._call_groq(...)
            elif provider == "anthropic":
                return self._call_anthropic(...)
        except: fallback_to_next_provider()
```

**After:**
```python
from litellm import acompletion

response = await acompletion(
    model="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    messages=[...],
    fallbacks=["claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "gpt-4o"]
)
```

### Benefits
- ✅ -70% code reduction (400 → 120 LOC wrapper for cost tracking)
- ✅ Automatic retries, rate limiting, timeout handling
- ✅ Support for 100+ LLM providers (add new models in 1 line)
- ✅ Streaming support built-in

### Migration Steps
1. Install: `pip install litellm==1.77.7` (already in Dockerfile)
2. Create `LiteLLMService` wrapper (preserve cost tracking)
3. Update enrichment_service.py, editor_service.py (5 files)
4. Update 17 unit tests
5. Verify cost tracking granularity preserved

### Files Affected
- `src/services/llm_service.py` - Rewrite as thin wrapper
- `tests/unit/test_llm_service.py` - Update mocks
- `src/services/enrichment_service.py` - Use new API
- `src/services/editor_service.py` - Use new API
- `requirements.txt` - Already has litellm==1.77.7

### Testing
```bash
# Run enrichment tests
docker exec rag_service pytest tests/unit/test_llm_service.py -v
docker exec rag_service pytest tests/unit/test_enrichment_service.py -v

# Verify cost tracking
curl http://localhost:8001/cost/stats | jq '.cost_per_doc'
```

### Rollback Plan
Keep v2.2.0 tag. If issues arise:
```bash
git checkout v2.2.0
docker-compose up -d --build
```

---

## Phase 2: Instructor Integration (Week 2)

### What Changes
Replace custom JSON validation with Instructor for type-safe LLM responses.

**Before:**
```python
response = await llm.call(prompt)
json_str = extract_json(response)
validated = schema_validator.validate(json_str, EnrichmentSchema)
```

**After:**
```python
import instructor
client = instructor.from_litellm(litellm_client)

enrichment = await client.chat.completions.create(
    model="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    response_model=EnrichmentSchema,  # Pydantic model
    messages=[...]
)
# enrichment is already validated Pydantic object
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Remove schema_validator.py (-150 LOC)
- ✅ Auto-retry on validation failures
- ✅ Type-safe responses (no more JSON parsing bugs)
- ✅ Works seamlessly with LiteLLM

### Migration Steps
1. Install: `pip install instructor`
2. Remove `schema_validator.py`
3. Update enrichment_service.py to use Instructor
4. Simplify editor_service.py (no manual JSON validation)
5. Update 30 unit tests

### Files Affected
- `src/services/schema_validator.py` - DELETE
- `src/services/enrichment_service.py` - Simplify validation
- `src/services/editor_service.py` - Simplify patch generation
- `tests/unit/test_schema_validator.py` - DELETE (15 tests)
- `tests/unit/test_enrichment_service.py` - Update assertions

### Testing
```bash
# Enrichment with auto-validation
docker exec rag_service pytest tests/unit/test_enrichment_service.py -v

# Upload test document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/ingest/file -F "file=@test.pdf" | jq
```

---

## Phase 3: Unstructured Integration (Week 3) - OPTIONAL

### What Changes
Replace custom `document_service.py` (500 LOC) with Unstructured library for document parsing.

**Before:**
```python
# Custom parsers for PDF, DOCX, etc.
class DocumentService:
    def extract_text(self, file_path):
        if file_path.endswith('.pdf'):
            return self._parse_pdf()
        elif file_path.endswith('.docx'):
            return self._parse_docx()
        # ...13 more formats
```

**After:**
```python
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition

elements = partition(file_path)  # Auto-detects format
text = "\n".join([e.text for e in elements])
```

### Benefits
- ✅ -90% code reduction (500 → 50 LOC wrapper)
- ✅ Better table extraction
- ✅ Better image/layout handling
- ✅ Support for more formats automatically

### Trade-offs
- ⚠️ Docker image size: +500MB (models for layout detection)
- ⚠️ First-time setup more complex

### Migration Steps
1. Install: `pip install unstructured[pdf]==0.18.15` (already in Dockerfile)
2. Create `UnstructuredDocumentService` wrapper
3. Preserve metadata extraction logic
4. Update 15 unit tests
5. Verify parsing quality on test corpus

### Files Affected
- `src/services/document_service.py` - Rewrite as thin wrapper
- `tests/unit/test_document_service.py` - Update test fixtures
- `Dockerfile` - Already has unstructured installed

### Testing
```bash
# Test document parsing
docker exec rag_service pytest tests/unit/test_document_service.py -v

# Upload complex PDF with tables
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/ingest/file -F "file=@complex.pdf"
```

### Decision Point
Evaluate after Phase 1+2. If parsing quality is acceptable, may defer to v3.1.

**Actual Decision:** Skipped. Custom parsers work well, Unstructured reserved for specialized table extraction.

---

## Phase 4: Architecture Cleanup (Week 4) - FOLLOW-UP

### Modularize app.py (1,472 LOC)

**Move business logic to services:**
```python
# NEW: src/services/rag_service.py
class RAGService:
    async def ingest_document(self, file):
        # Document → Parse → Enrich → Chunk → Embed → Store

# app.py becomes thin routing layer (~744 LOC)
@router.post("/ingest/file")
async def ingest_file(file):
    return await rag_service.ingest_document(file)
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Easier to test (pure Python vs FastAPI routes)
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable orchestration logic

### Files Affected
- `src/services/rag_service.py` - NEW (1,069 LOC, 21 methods)
- `src/routes/` - NEW (10 modular route files)
- `app.py` - Reduced to 744 LOC

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Code Reduction
```
llm_service.py:           400 → 120 LOC  (-70%)
document_service.py:      500 → 50 LOC   (-90%) [SKIPPED]
schema_validator.py:      150 → 0 LOC    (-100%) [KEPT for iteration loop]
enrichment_service.py:    -30% simplification
app.py:                   1472 → 744 LOC (-49%)
---
Total:                    ~728 LOC reduced in app.py
                          +325 LOC overall (new orchestrator)
```

### Test Changes
```
Before: 585 unit tests
After:  955 unit tests (+370 new tests)
Pass rate: 100% maintained
```

### Dependency Changes
```
Add:    litellm (already present)
Add:    instructor
Keep:   unstructured (already present, optional use)
Remove: None (only consolidating)
```

### Performance Impact
- Latency: No change (same underlying APIs)
- Reliability: ↑ (battle-tested libraries)
- Cost: No change (same models)
- Maintainability: ↑↑ (less custom code, better architecture)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Low-Risk Approach
1. **Incremental:** One phase per week, fully tested before next
2. **Reversible:** Keep v2.2.0 tag, can rollback any phase
3. **Tested:** Maintain 100% unit test pass rate throughout
4. **Documented:** Update docs after each phase

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Rollback entire v3.0
git checkout v2.2.0 && docker-compose up -d --build

# Rollback specific phase (if on feature branch)
git revert <phase_commit>
```

**Q: What if LiteLLM doesn't preserve cost tracking?**
A: Create thin wrapper that logs costs via callbacks. LiteLLM supports custom callbacks. ✅ DONE

**Q: Can we skip Unstructured?**
A: Yes, Phase 3 is optional. Current document parsing works well. ✅ SKIPPED

**Q: What about existing data in ChromaDB?**
A: No changes to embeddings/storage. All existing data compatible. ✅ VERIFIED
