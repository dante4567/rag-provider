- [Be specific about success rates, performance]

### **What's Broken/Limited**
- [List current issues and limitations]
- [Be honest about failure modes]

### **Production Reality**

## Examples of Good Honest Assessments

### ‚úÖ Good Example
"This OCR processor works for clear text in images but fails on handwriting or poor quality scans. Takes 2-3 seconds per image. Good enough for 80% of business documents, terrible for historical documents."

### ‚ùå Bad Example
"Advanced OCR solution with cutting-edge accuracy." (Marketing speak, no real info)

### ‚úÖ Good Example
"Saves 70-95% on LLM costs vs alternatives, confirmed through testing. Setup takes 2-4 hours. Works great for small teams, breaks under heavy load."

### ‚ùå Bad Example
"Revolutionary cost optimization framework." (Vague, no specifics)

## Mandatory Elements

1. **Specific numbers**: Success rates, costs, performance metrics
2. **Real limitations**: What breaks, when it fails, edge cases
3. **Use case guidance**: When to use vs when to avoid
4. **Time investment**: Setup time, maintenance needs
5. **Comparison reality**: How it actually compares to alternatives

## Tone Guidelines

- **Brutally honest** about limitations
- **Specific** with numbers and examples
- **Practical** with real-world guidance
- **No marketing speak** or exaggerated claims
- **Focus on user value** not feature lists

Remember: Users trust honest assessments more than marketing claims. Being transparent about limitations builds more confidence than hiding them.
