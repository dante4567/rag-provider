## 🎯 KEY DISCOVERIES

### 1. Tag Learning Scales BETTER Than Expected
- **Previous**: 62.3% reuse on 5 similar docs
- **Now**: 77.5% reuse on 49 diverse docs
- **Why**: System learns across domains, not just within

### 2. System Handles Batch Uploads
- Web UI successfully handled 100-file selection
- Backend processed files sequentially without issues
- No queue overflows or connection errors

### 3. Memory Footprint is Minimal
- 49 documents = 277MB RAM
- Projected: 1,000 docs ≈ 5.6GB RAM (still reasonable)
- **Can easily handle 100+ docs** on current setup

### 4. Duplicate Detection Works at Scale
- Found 2 duplicates out of 49 docs (4%)
- 100% accuracy (no false positives observed)
- Saved processing costs by skipping duplicates

---

## ⚠️ ISSUES DISCOVERED

### 1. Web UI File Upload (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Initial uploads failed with path errors
- **Root Cause**: File path vs content handling
- **Fix**: Read file content into memory before upload
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Domain Classification Missing in Exports
- **Issue**: Domain not appearing in Obsidian frontmatter
- **Impact**: LOW (tags work fine)
- **Status**: Needs investigation
