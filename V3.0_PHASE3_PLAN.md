- Reranking result caching

**Effort:** ~3-4 hours
**Value:** Medium (quality improvement)
**Complexity:** Medium-High

### Option 3: Embedding Model Upgrade

**Goal:** Switch from sentence-transformers to Voyage embeddings

**What to Change:**
1. Implement Voyage API integration
2. Re-embed existing documents
3. Benchmark quality improvement
4. Cost analysis

**Current:** sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Dimensions: 384
- MTEB: 56.3
- Cost: FREE

**Target:** Voyage-3-lite
- Dimensions: 512
- MTEB: 68.8 (+22%)
- Cost: $0.02/1M tokens

**Effort:** ~2 hours
**Value:** High (retrieval quality)
**Cost Impact:** $0.000002 per document (minimal)

**Benefits:**
- +22% retrieval quality (MTEB improvement)
- Still very cost-effective
- Better semantic understanding
- Maintained by embedding specialists

### Option 4: Multi-Modal Document Processing

**Goal:** Enhance vision LLM integration for images/scanned PDFs

**What to Build:**
1. Automatic OCR quality detection
2. Smart fallback (OCR ‚Üí Vision LLM)
3. Image-based entity extraction
4. Table extraction from images

**Current State:**
- Vision LLM service exists (Gemini)
- Basic OCR quality assessment
- 23 tests for visual_llm_service

**Improvements:**
- Automatic quality-based routing
- Better table extraction
- Multi-page document processing

**Effort:** ~4-5 hours
**Value:** Medium (handles edge cases)
**Complexity:** High

### Option 5: Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Profile and optimize the retrieval pipeline

**What to Optimize:**
1. Batch embedding generation
2. Parallel chunk processing
3. ChromaDB query optimization
4. Caching layer for frequent queries

**Current Performance:**
- Document ingestion: ~2-3s per doc
- Search query: ~200-300ms
- Reranking: ~100-200ms

**Target:**
- Document ingestion: <1s
- Search query: <100ms
- Reranking: <50ms

**Effort:** ~3-4 hours
**Value:** Medium (user experience)
**Complexity:** Medium

## Recommendation

### üéØ Phase 3: Test Coverage for Critical Services

**Why this is the best choice:**

1. **Production Readiness**
   - `rag_service.py` is the main orchestrator (~1500 lines)
   - Currently untested = high risk in production
   - Tests act as documentation and safety net

2. **Foundation for Future Work**
   - Can't safely optimize what we can't test
   - Enables confident refactoring
   - Better debugging when issues arise

3. **Quick Win**
   - 2-3 hours to achieve 100% service coverage
   - Immediate value (catch bugs now, not in production)
   - Sets up CI/CD for deployment

4. **Aligns with V3.0 Goals**
   - Phase 1: Modernize LLM layer ‚úÖ
   - Phase 2: Type-safe responses ‚úÖ
   - Phase 3: Production readiness ‚úÖ

5. **Low Risk, High Reward**
   - No API changes
   - No user-facing changes
   - Just safety improvements

### After Phase 3 (Test Coverage)

Once we have 100% test coverage, we can confidently proceed to:
- **Option 3** (Voyage embeddings) - Highest quality improvement
- **Option 2** (Advanced reranking) - Further quality gains
- **Option 5** (Performance) - Scale optimization

## Implementation Plan: Phase 3 (Test Coverage)

### Step 1: Test rag_service.py (Main Orchestrator)

**What to Test:**
- Document ingestion flow
- Multi-stage enrichment
- Entity deduplication integration
- Obsidian export generation

### Step 3: Test calendar_service.py + contact_service.py

**What to Test:**
- Calendar event extraction
- Contact entity parsing
- Deduplication logic
- vCard/iCal generation

**Test Count:** ~20-25 tests

### Expected Outcome

- **Total New Tests:** 65-85 tests
- **Total Tests After:** 648-668 tests
- **Service Coverage:** 35/35 (100%)
- **Time Investment:** 2-3 hours
- **Production Readiness:** ‚úÖ

## Decision Matrix

**What should we do for Phase 3?**

I recommend **Option 1: Test Coverage** for maximum production readiness with minimal risk.

Would you like to proceed with test coverage, or would you prefer one of the other options?
