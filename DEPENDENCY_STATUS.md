# Dependency Status - Brutally Honest Assessment

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT ACTUALLY PINNED (Despite what requirements.txt header claims)

## Current Reality

**requirements.txt uses `>=` operators** - This means "install this version or newer", NOT exact pinning.

```python
# This is NOT pinned:
fastapi>=0.104.1  # Could install 0.104.1, 0.105.0, 1.0.0, etc.

# This IS pinned:
fastapi==0.104.1  # Exact version only
```

## Why Not Pinned Yet

**Honest reasons:**
1. Port conflicts prevent starting Docker containers for `pip freeze`
   - Port 8000: In use by openwebui-chromadb
   - Port 8001: In use by openwebui-weather
2. Local Python environment lacks pip
3. Original requirements.txt claimed "pinned" but actually uses `>=`

## What We Know Works

Based on testing during Week 2 (October 2025):
- All 11 tested services passed with current `>=` requirements
- Docker build succeeds
- 179 tests execute without dependency errors

## Recommended Action for Production

**Option 1: Pin via Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
# Stop conflicting containers
docker stop openwebui-chromadb

# Build and run RAG service
docker-compose up -d

# Generate pinned requirements
docker exec rag_service pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt

# Use requirements-lock.txt for production
```

**Option 2: Use current >= requirements (Acceptable for dev)**
- Current setup: Works for development
- Risk: Future versions may break compatibility
- Mitigation: CI/CD should catch breaking changes

## What Should Happen (Week 3)

1. **Resolve port conflicts** - Stop or reconfigure OpenWebUI containers
2. **Generate requirements-lock.txt** - Run pip freeze in working container
3. **Test with pinned versions** - Ensure all tests still pass
4. **Update Dockerfile** - Use requirements-lock.txt instead
5. **Document exact versions** - List tested version combinations

## Current Grade Impact

- **Before pinning:** C+ (74/100)
- **After pinning:** B (76/100) - Small bump for production-readiness

**Bottom line:** Service works but dependency versions could change unexpectedly. Not critical for dev/testing, but needed before production deployment.
